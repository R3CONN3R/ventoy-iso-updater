"""Smoke-test every resolver in the catalog against the live upstreams.

The script depends on ~50 foreign directory layouts. When one of them changes,
the matching resolver stops finding an ISO -- and the only way to notice is to
ask the upstreams. Run this on a schedule so a broken layout shows up here
instead of in front of the Ventoy stick.

Exit code is 1 if any resolver failed, 0 otherwise.
